This library contains code investigating view dependency with 3D shape
representations using paperclip objects. The purpose is to replicate 
view dependency findings that are traditionally presented as evidence
for 2D shape representations with 3D shape representation. We look at
two findings from literature
1. Experiment 1: Canonical view effect. Similar to Experiment 1 in 
[Edelman and Bulthoff (1992)][EB1992].
2. Experiment 2: View interpolation/extrapolation effects as investigated
in [Bulthoff and Edelman (1992)][BE1992]
